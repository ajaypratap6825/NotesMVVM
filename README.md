# NotesMVVM
It is a Notes taking app using Java language. I have used MVVM architecture with LiveData, Room database, and RecyclerView.
The user can also set a priority along with the title and description for the note. Users can also edit their notes by just clicking on them. There is also a feature of deleting all the notes.
I have LiveData for a list of notes so that the recycler view gets updated every time for all changes and used Room database for storing notes in the user's device.
